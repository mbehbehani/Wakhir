Description: 
A mobile app that records the interactions among individuals using peer-to-peer connectivity to help reducing or controlling the spread of Corona virus.

Key features:

1- The user will create a profile providing information including (gender, nationality, age, medical history, etc) linking the account to his/her verified mobile number and email. 

2- The user will be given a unique ID shared with the authorities (ministry of health).

2- At any time a user can update his/her own health status (symptoms, Corona virus test result, travel history, etc). Alternatively, the status can be changed by the admin (ministry) based on tests.

3- As users move close to each other (WiFi/Bluetooth distance)  their devices will detect each other and communicate via short messages in the background using Bluetooth or WiFi Direct (P2P) (No Internet is needed). Discovered users will be shown to the user without revealing their personal identities (Only showing gender, skin colour, physical shape, nationality, glasses, etc) so they can be identified among the discovered users.

4- Each user’s device stores a list (tree) of all interactions he/she had over a defined period (14 days?) which will be forwarded to users approaching by in the future and may be uploaded to the App server (owned by ministry). 

5- All received interactions are processed by an intelligent algorithm (AI?) residing on the indiviual device (and server) that analyses the risk level of the user’s recent exposures and update his/her risk status accordingly. 

6- When a user approaches another user with a high risk, the approaching using will be notified by the app to take precaution. While users are moving by cars, the app should be smart enough to detect and ignore users in other cars within P2P distance. 

7- A user can manually indicate the interactions with all the recently discovered users such as if they shock hands, kissed, exchanged personal items, etc. 

8- In case a user tested positive or developed symptoms, all users who had interactions with the infected user will receive instant notification (through Internet connection). Also, users who interacted with those who contacted the positively-tested user will receive notifications and so on. 

9- Users who are determined by the algorithm (according to authority standards) as requiring self-quarantine or hospital quarantine will be marked so and notifications will be immediately broadcast to the authorities as well as all users interacted with them recently. 

10- Users who do not abide by the quarantine measures will be reported by the app to the authorities. Those users even if not carrying their phones or disabling the connectivity can be reported by other users who know them personally. 

11- A user can add individuals living in his household who are unable to join the app such as children and manually define their interactions with others. 

12- A user who contact an individual not shown in his/her discovered list, may indicate this interaction manually by providing the persons’ details (phone number, etc). Later, if this persons joins the app, this interaction will then show on the newly joining user’s list.



Extra features:

1- The app will send frequent hand-wash reminders to the user based on their interactions and movements. 

2- A smart watch version can detect if a user raised his hand to his face and reminds the user to wash hands immediately. 

3- User’s travel/commuting status is continuously monitored by the app using GPS and P2P interactions and points are earned accordingly. Users with high scores may be rewarded (creating incentives).
